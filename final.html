			<b>🍀What is Environmental Friendliness?🍀</b>
</p>
<p>
Environment friendly processes, or environmental-friendly processes (also referred to as eco-friendly, nature-friendly, and green), are sustainability and marketing terms referring to goods and services, laws, guidelines and policies that claim reduced, minimal, or no harm upon ecosystems or the environment.

  <b>🍀Why is it important to be Environmentally Friendly? What are people doing wrong?🍀</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Being Environmentally Friendly is becoming more and more important. Many people are taking the world for granted and just littering like it's no big deal. Some people do that because they think: 'It's just one piece of tissue' but if everybody thinks that, then it would be not just one piece, it would be millions. So everybody has a role to play, to keep the world a clean place where we can all feel comfortable. It is also important because we wouldn't want to walk around a neighbourhood full of trash, even picking up a piece of rubbish on the ground, instead of ignoring it, can really help the Environment. Everybody should keep a positive mindset and have the determination to make the world a better place, not letting it just crumble around them.

  <b>🍀What are some Environmental Problems?🍀</b>
</p>
<p>Some of the Environmental problems we face today include cutting down of trees,  limiting supplies, Global Warming etc. These problems are all around us, we know they exist but at the same time most people don't do anything about it. If we don't bring these problems into attention for everybody, in a few years time, the earth won't be so green anymore.We should also not waste paper so often, it may seem like a small matter but the paper we use come from trees and the ore we use, the more trees will have to be cut down to make sure that there is enough supply in the shops.
