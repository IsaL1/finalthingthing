          These are Nacho Chips EVOLVED  :D</a>
        </div>
        <p> A nacho is something like a chip, just that you can easily ruin it with a substance called 'Nacho Cheese' many people enjoy Nachos but I never see it in the supermarket probably because I don't even look for Nachos. Nachos are one of <b>those</b> things that you say everyody loves but then you yourself realise that you don't even like Nachos that much. Oh, just me? Oh well :> </p>
        <p> Ignacio "Nacho" Anaya invented Nachos in 1940 at the Victory Club in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico. The original nachos consisted of an individual quarter of freshly fried corn tortilla, cheese and a slice of jalape√±o pepper. I preffer them plain..<b>DON'T JUDGE</b></p>

        <h2 id="part1">Why I think Nachos are amazing</h2>
        <h3>My Reason</h3>
        <p>Nachos are amazing in that they are just like normal chips but just by adding three letters, BBQ, it can become more expensive :D Some people like their Nachos to be BBQ flavoured..but why? Wait. You expect me to actually know this stuff? Well, I don't :)) Have fun wasting your time reading the rest of this un-educational junk just so you can get even more bored then you were before!! :DD No need to thank me, actually...yeah, <b>THANK ME</B> UwUz</p>
        <p>Now read this fake story I made up to waste more of your time :))

        Before Nachos were invented, everybody only had plain soggy chips U^U But then..the illuminati conspiricy started going around and that's when Johnny Yes Papa got a brand new idea! He decided to make a rip-off of chips and call them Nachos, just chips but triangle shaped, no, ILLUMINATI SHAPED. The first man to try them was, the great man himself, Johnny Yes Papa's Papa! And that's how Nacho's came about :)) Totally not Ignacio "Nacho" Anaya who invented them like I said before :D Infact, Ignacio Anaya IS Johnny Yes Papa in disguise :OOO  Jk this is fake news pls don't take this to offence .-.      </p>
